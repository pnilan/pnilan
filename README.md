### Heyo ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack engineer with a focus in backend optimization. I love the process of optimizing code for faster speed and improved organization/readability. 

While in my previous career as a Civil Engineer, I effectively managed multiple simultaneous projects and stakeholders while innovating new strategies to reduce costs and to meet project requirements. Through my analysis into each projectâ€™s costs, I honed my ability to identify areas for optimization and improvement.

My proficiency in finding and optimizing inefficiencies directly translates into my ability as a software engineer. Through the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, I showcased my ability to build full-stack applications that demanded efficient and reliable solutions. I optimized my code to ensure speed and reliability, even under high loads.

By combining my background in civil engineering and my passion for software engineering, I bring a unique perspective to problem solving and a commitment to efficiency.
